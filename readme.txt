== Description ==
Check if the user can see protected content 

(This is a proof of conenpt ONLY, do NOT use)

This plugin checks to see if each post being returned has a metadata tag of "lowestLevel" it then does a Webservice call to our internal software which holds the information about if a user has purchased support. If the user has not purchased the required support they are redirected to another warning page or the login page.
